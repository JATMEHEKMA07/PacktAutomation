AUTOMATION SOFTWARE AND REPORTING
1.Eclipse is easy to use and opensource and for reporting we use Cucumber.
Eclipse is an IDE primarily used for writing and managing code in various programming languages, including Java. It provides a range of features like code editing, debugging, version control integration, and project management.
Many test automation engineers and developers use Eclipse to write and maintain their test scripts, including those built with Selenium, Appium, JUnit, TestNG, or other testing frameworks.
Eclipse is not specifically used for automation; rather, it's a flexible environment that supports automation efforts by providing a powerful platform for writing, editing, and running code

2.Cucumber plugin should be installed in Eclipse
Cucumber is used because in  testing framework that promotes collaboration between developers, testers, and non-technical stakeholders. It allows you to write test scenarios in a natural language format (Gherkin) that is easily understandable by non-technical team members.
Cucumber helps implement behavior-driven development (BDD) by encouraging the creation of executable specifications that are both human-readable and can be automated.
One of Cucumber's key features is generating human-readable reports, which make it easier for non-technical team members to understand the test results.

RUNING PROCEDURE
1.First take this url and run git clone url in your pc then import it into the Eclipse IDE 
After importing go to target folder and go to cucumber html report inside it open feature overview html 
open this report inside which you can see the reports of this test cases
2.For running right click on project and click on run as option inside it click on run as maven test on 7th option
then console below in which you can see the output on test case

DIFFICULTY FACED
1.Some functionality changing their WebElement
2.During automating login scenario some time captcha occurs which we have to do manually unless the script fails.
